The goal of this program is to allow a user to generate a simple HTML file with employee details.
I desire to allow the user to add as many employees that they wish, and in any order.           

0 - User starts with NPM start 

1 - User is shown a list of options [questionOne.employeeType], which role are they adding. They can choose to not add. 

1.0 - If not adding anymore roles the user chooses options [None] -- > this triggers renderHTML, the user is presented with options to choose from.


1.1 - If adding a manager, the main 3 questions should be called, and 1 role specific question should be asked.
1.2 - If adding a engineer, the main 3 questions should be called, and 1 role specific question should be asked.
1.3 - If adding a engineer, the main 3 questions should be called, and 1 role specific question should be asked.

2. Where user has finished adding employees, selects [None] render HTML will be the next question executed.
There are four options, and depending on which is chosen the program should execute accordingly.
